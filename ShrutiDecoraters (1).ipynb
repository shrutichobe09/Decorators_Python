    "Can a decorator be implemented without using closures? Why or why not?\n",
    "\n",
    "Closures: A closure is a function that \"remembers\" the values of variables from its enclosing scope,\n",
    "even after the enclosing scope has finished executing. This \"remembering\" is crucial for many Python concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Decorators: In Python, a decorator is a higher-order function that takes another function as an argument\n",
    "and returns a modified version of that function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Closures are like functions with memory: They \"remember\" variables from where they were created, \n",
    "even after that place is gone.\n",
    "Decorators use this memory: Decorators are like wrappers for other functions.\n",
    " They use closures to \"remember\" the original function and any extra instructions they need to follow.\n",
    "Example: Imagine you have a function to make coffee. A decorator is like adding extra steps to that function\n",
    "(like grinding beans before and cleaning the machine after). Closures help the decorator \"remember\" to do those extra steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "Certainly, let's break down the relationship between decorators and closures, and whether decorators can exist without closures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Decorators and Closures: A Tight Bond\n",
    "\n",
    "Closures: A closure is a function that \"remembers\" the values of variables from its enclosing scope, even after the enclosing scope has finished executing. This \"remembering\" is crucial for many Python concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Decorators: In Python, a decorator is a higher-order function that takes another function as an argument and returns a modified version of that function.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Connection: Decorators heavily rely on closures to achieve their functionality. Here's how:\n",
    "\n",
    "The Inner Function: The decorator typically defines an inner function.\n",
    "Capturing Variables: This inner function \"captures\" variables (like arguments, or even variables defined within the decorator itself) from the enclosing scope (the decorator function).\n",
    "Returning the Inner Function: The decorator then returns this inner function.\n",
    "This closure mechanism allows the inner function to access and use the captured variables, even though the decorator function has already finished executing. This is essential for modifying the behavior of the decorated function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Can Decorators Exist Without Closures?\n",
    "\n",
    "No. Decorators, in their core essence, cannot exist without closures. Here's why:\n",
    "\n",
    "Modifying Behavior: The primary purpose of a decorator is to alter the behavior of a function. To do this,\n",
    " it needs to somehow \"wrap\" the original function.\n",
    "Closures as the Mechanism: Closures provide the necessary mechanism for this wrapping. The inner function,\n",
    " created within the decorator, effectively \"wraps\" the original function by:\n",
    "Potentially performing actions before the original function is called.\n",
    "Potentially modifying the arguments passed to the original function.\n",
    "Potentially modifying the return value of the original function.\n",
    "Potentially performing actions after the original function is called.\n",
